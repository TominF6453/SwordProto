# SwordProto -- Claymore

Project has gotten far enough that I want to keep a repo online at this point.

## Description

A prototype for a level-based speedrun game. Will feature movement-heavy combat and platforming, leaderboards for kill completion and time elapsed on a level.
Something similar to Neon White.
Plan to have different characters with different movement, but starting with the sword (claymore) movement which involves throwing the sword to warp to its position.
